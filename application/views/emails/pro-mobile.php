Hello <?php echo $to; ?>,

Great news! Your mobile payment of £1 for a one-week subscription of Criminal Outlaws PRO subscription was successful and it has been credited to your account respectively. We charged the number <?php echo $number; ?> from the <?php echo $network; ?> mobile provider and your order number is <?php echo $order; ?>.

Due to the nature of mobile payments, we do not offer a grace period and therefore you cannot be refunded for your payment. As mobile payments cannot be automatically charged, your subscription will expire on <?php echo unix_to_human($expires); ?> automatically and to renew it you will need to make your mobile payment again.

If you make multiple mobile payments at once, your membership will be extended for another week. If you have any problems with your purchase, or have any questions to ask us, please do not hesitate to contact us at cosupport@ferple.com and we will reply shortly.

Regards,
Criminal Outlaws,
