<h3 class="stylish">Privacy Policy</h3>
<h6 class="slogan">It's always our biggest priority when dealing with your information.</h6>
<p class='text-xsmall' style='line-height:22px;'>At Criminal Outlaws, we believe that every user should be given a respectful and genuine option to have privacy of their information exactly the way it should be. That's why we spend a lot of money and resources to improve the way we deal with our players, and so you can play knowing you fully control your information.</p>
<br />
<p class='title' style='padding-left:10px;'><b>EMAIL ADDRESSES</b></p>
<p class='text-xsmall' style='line-height:22px; padding-left:10px;'>Your email address is one of the most sensitive sets of information we store from you, and it is used entirely to provide transactional data to you that you would not otherwise be informed about (such as new messages, announcements, achievements, events, etc) which you can control as to whether you wish to receive these.<br />
<br />
We offer an adequate way for our users to disable e-mail notifications, which can either be through your preferences, or if you contact our support, we can permanently disable e-mail notifications to a certain e-mail address if you did not register for an account. Due to the significant size of our platform, we offload our e-mails to a third party which is one of the world's biggest providers of e-mail delivery (Amazon Web Services) therefore transmitting your e-mail address to them is securely provided to them and is backed by their respective agreements.<br />
<br />
No third parties or other users can access your e-mail address in any way possible, and will not ever be able to without your implied permission. Any transmission of your e-mail address within the website is given at your sole discretion and therefore you are held responsible for any problems which may be caused by misuse.</p>
<br />
<p class='title' style='padding-left:10px;'><b>ACCOUNT PASSWORDS</b></p>
<p class='text-xsmall' style='line-height:22px; padding-left:10px;'>As we have designed the entire infrastructure in-house, we have used the most difficult and sophisticated one-way encryption algorithms which greatly reduces the chances of anyone obtaining your passwords. There are many different levels of encryption which we apply to our users data that fluctuate on a huge variety of factors that means there is no real possible way of finding your password and any available ways are made harder by encouraging our users to make their passwords at least six characters.<br />
<br />
We strongly advise that our users change their passwords at least once per week, especially if they are a paid user or have anything of considerable value within their account, and if you do not change your password and become a victim of password theft then we cannot be held responsible for any damages held to your account however if you identify that someone else has logged into your account, we advise you contact our support team so we can help mitigate any attacks to your account.</p>
